But in November, his position changed dramatically : he left the post of CEO of FTX and began bankruptcy proceedings (along with Alameda Research and 130 other partner companies), and his fortune was destroyed after the fall in the value of FTX&amp;rsquo;s business to $1.</description></item><item><title>Amendments for applicants for Golden Visas in the UAE: what they change</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6373be209a7947fb386fc99a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2022 14:59:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6373be209a7947fb386fc99a/</guid><description>Over the past couple of years, the demand for real estate in Dubai and in the UAE as a whole has grown significantly.

Now corporations are preparing for new challenges.
Against the backdrop of inflation, the purchasing power of the population is falling, and workers are demanding higher salaries. Despite the fact that many European companies are experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel, not all firms are ready to accommodate employees, fearing that this will negatively affect the financial performance of the companies themselves.</description></item><item><title>What economic theory caused the global recession</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6374e1769a79475cdbaaa663/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:13:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6374e1769a79475cdbaaa663/</guid><description>Modern Monetary Theory (CMT) is a relatively new approach to economic regulation. It appeared in the early 1990s and suggests that the state can issue a sovereign currency without regard to negative factors for the economy.
Supporters of the MMT claim that, if properly regulated, an increase in the money supply will not cause inflation and a deterioration in the economic condition of the country. However, in practice it turned out that the theory does not work as its adherents expected.</description></item><item><title>How users and advertisers are fleeing Twitter Elon Musk</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6373b4299a7947f7e5f6fd65/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 14:38:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/6373b4299a7947f7e5f6fd65/</guid><description>The drama surrounding the Elon Musk-Twitter deal seemed to be over with the final agreement between the parties. However, it turned out that everything was just beginning: the new owner began to radically rebuild the work of the social network, look for additional sources of funding and argue with politicians, officials, advertisers and ordinary users.
Disappointed with Musk&amp;rsquo;s actions, Twitter users began to look for an alternative to the social network.</description></item><item><title>Why the Japanese economy is falling again and what will happen to it next</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/63738f8b9a7947e7e6442c83/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 14:22:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/63738f8b9a7947e7e6442c83/</guid><description>The Japanese economy, the third largest in the world, unexpectedly showed a fall in July-September after nine months of steady growth.

Hopes that the US Federal Reserve would change course did not come true: the increase in interest rates would be more serious than previously thought.

On Monday, the value of digital currencies fell again as the market situation worsened over the weekend.
Some in the industry have said that the fall of FTX was &amp;ldquo;Lehman&amp;rsquo;s moment&amp;rdquo;, drawing parallels to the collapse of the investment bank in 2008, which was the starting point of the global crisis. The founder of Binance agreed with this metaphor, saying that comparing the current turmoil in the cryptocurrency market with the 2008 global financial crisis is an exact analogy.</description></item><item><title>Unreliable person: how the head of FTX lost $16 billion in a matter of days</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/637264559a79478c20090632/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:29:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/637264559a79478c20090632/</guid><description>FTX, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, was valued at $32 billion in early 2022.

In the summer of 2022, after the collapse of the cryptocurrency market, Bankman-Fried actively supported crypto companies that found themselves in a difficult financial situation.</description></item><item><title>The United States recognized Russia as a “country with a non-market economy.” What does it mean</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e4ff99a794711b44c0b3b/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 08:59:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e4ff99a794711b44c0b3b/</guid><description>The US Department of Commerce announced Thursday that it has changed the status of the Russian economy from &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;non-market.&amp;rdquo; The move is aimed at further reducing bilateral trade and isolating Russia amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, experts say.
The decision follows a significant increase in Moscow&amp;rsquo;s interference in economic activity since the beginning of last year, the ministry said. This introduced an imbalance in the work of the sphere of foreign exchange markets, labor relations and foreign investment.</description></item><item><title>End of an Era: Will Social Media Stocks Stop Rising?</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e00579a7947eb973f2807/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 09:38:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e00579a7947eb973f2807/</guid><description>This year has led to a record drop in social media stocks.

Inflation that persists despite all the efforts of regulators, a more than 50% chance of a recession, the pressure of rising interest rates and the expectation of further geopolitical escalation make not only the American but also the world community closely monitor the voting results.
The elections will determine the composition of Congress, which has the authority to develop fiscal policy, trade with foreign countries and regulate the public debt.</description></item><item><title>The United States began a technological blockade of China.

Before the landmark 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Joe Biden administration announced serious new restrictions on the sale of semiconductor technologies to China.
The new measures from the US Department of Commerce are largely aimed at slowing down the development of Chinese military programs. In their technology, they use supercomputers to simulate nuclear explosions, control hypersonic weapons and create advanced networks to monitor political dissenters and minorities, writes The New York Times.</description></item><item><title>“The worst is yet to come”: why economists consider a US recession inevitable</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/634ea5049a79472ea711b05a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:22:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/634ea5049a79472ea711b05a/</guid><description>Discussions about the likelihood of a recession in the world&amp;rsquo;s largest economy have been going on for several months.

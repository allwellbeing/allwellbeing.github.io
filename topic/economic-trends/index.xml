Boosting periods in the stock market, such as the one that peaked in January, are usually accompanied by an increase in fraud.</description></item><item><title>The United States recognized Russia as a “country with a non-market economy.” What does it mean</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e4ff99a794711b44c0b3b/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 08:59:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e4ff99a794711b44c0b3b/</guid><description>The US Department of Commerce announced Thursday that it has changed the status of the Russian economy from &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;non-market.&amp;rdquo; The move is aimed at further reducing bilateral trade and isolating Russia amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, experts say.
The decision follows a significant increase in Moscow&amp;rsquo;s interference in economic activity since the beginning of last year, the ministry said. This introduced an imbalance in the work of the sphere of foreign exchange markets, labor relations and foreign investment.</description></item><item><title>End of an Era: Will Social Media Stocks Stop Rising?</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e00579a7947eb973f2807/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 09:38:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/636e00579a7947eb973f2807/</guid><description>This year has led to a record drop in social media stocks.

Inflation that persists despite all the efforts of regulators, a more than 50% chance of a recession, the pressure of rising interest rates and the expectation of further geopolitical escalation make not only the American but also the world community closely monitor the voting results.
The elections will determine the composition of Congress, which has the authority to develop fiscal policy, trade with foreign countries and regulate the public debt.</description></item><item><title>The United States began a technological blockade of China.

In their technology, they use supercomputers to simulate nuclear explosions, control hypersonic weapons and create advanced networks to monitor political dissenters and minorities, writes The New York Times.</description></item><item><title>“The worst is yet to come”: why economists consider a US recession inevitable</title><link>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/634ea5049a79472ea711b05a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:22:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://allwellbeing.github.io/news/634ea5049a79472ea711b05a/</guid><description>Discussions about the likelihood of a recession in the world&amp;rsquo;s largest economy have been going on for several months.
